# lookit-protocol-templates
This repository contains [Lookit protocol generator](https://lookit.readthedocs.io/projects/frameplayer/en/latest/utils/protocol-generator.html) templates for three types of studies: studies for babies, toddlers, or older children. They were created by Cynthia Gu for the Child Language Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. 

These templates contain frames such as initial instructions or setting up video that can be used for any study. They do not contain any actual trials. The wording used in each template is specific to the type of study:

* **baby-lookingtime-boilerplate.js:** for baby looking time studies
* **toddler-lookingtime-boilerplate.js:** for toddler looking time studies
* **schoolage-kids-boiletplate.js:** for school-age kid studies

If you spot a problem with any of the current templates or would like to request a new template, please create a new issue on Github!
